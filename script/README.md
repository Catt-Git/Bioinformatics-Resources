The analysis was carried out in an R Markdown (.Rmd) file and knitted into an HTML report (.html), which contains the full workflow, results, and visualizations.

If you are a student of QCB (first welcome, if you need any help contact me without any esitation!) you can open the file in RStudio, then download the libraries and please remember to modity the working space in R so that the program can find "Thyroid_carcinoma.RData" file
